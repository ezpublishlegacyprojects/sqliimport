=========================
 SQLIImport Installation
=========================

1. Install *sqlimport* folder in *extension/*
2. Activate the extension in an override of **site.ini**
3. Install the SQL schema (only mysql is currently supported) : *sql/mysql/schema.sql*
4. Regenerate autoloads for classes

::
  php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e -p

5. Clear all Caches

::
  php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-tag=ini
  php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all


6. Schedule the cronjob to run every 5 minutes (not less, but you can increase the delay)

::
  # Run import cronjob every 5min or more
  # $EZPUBLISHROOT stands for your eZ Publish installation directory
  # $PHP stands for the full path of your PHP binary
  */5 * * * * cd $EZPUBLISHROOT && $PHP runcronjobs.php sqliimport_run 2>&1


7. You are now ready to use SQLIImport. 
   You will need to develop an import handler that *understands* the source to import (see README file).
   You might want to set policy limitations for users, like limiting the launch of an import by type.
